     E                                          F#m                   B7
C.  As the deer yearns                   A. Hope in God, hope in God:
                              E
for running streams                        and you'll praise Him again.
           C#m    C#7           F#m
so my soul is yearning               C. Because He, He is my salvation:
     F#m                            B7       C#m    A       G#
for you my God.                            He is my God, He is my God.
               A            G#
My soul is thirsting for God,        A. Hope in God, hope in God
               A              B
the living God                             hope in God, hope in God,
    B/Bb/A                       G#
when shall I come                          and you will praise Him again.
  E                      E
and see the face of God?             C. How many times I say: 'My rock,

Tears are my bread day and night,          why have you forsaken me?'

while my enemies                           why do I walk so sadly
                        F#m
say to me all day long:                    oppressed by my enemy?
    F#m                                  B7
'Where is your God?                        My bones are crushed

where is your God?                         by listening all day long:

where is your God?'                        'Where is your God?
 B7                                          E
And this I remember                        where is your God?'

and my soul is filled with sadness         Lord, send your light and your truth
                                         F#m
how I used to walk                         let them lead me to your holy mountain
   E   G#                 B7
in the midst of rejoicing                  then I will be able to sing to you

Why are you cast down my soul?             a song of joy, a song of happiness
 C#m                         E   G#
why are you sighing within me?             with my guitar.

Why are you cast down my soul ...
